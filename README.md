  <h3>Cross-Functional Business Performance Analytics Across Finance, Sales, and Supply Chain</h3>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Business Insights 360 is an end-to-end business intelligence solution designed to support
    data-driven decision-making across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project consolidates operational and financial data into interactive Power BI dashboards,
    enabling stakeholders to monitor performance, understand profitability drivers, and identify
    operational issues across multiple markets, products, and sales channels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than analysing one function in isolation, the solution provides a unified view of
    business performance to support both strategic oversight and day-to-day decision-making.
  </p>

  <h2>Business Context</h2>
  <p>
    AtliQ Hardware is a growing hardware and electronics company operating across physical retail
    and online sales channels. As the business expanded across regions, products, and customer
    segments, leadership required a centralised reporting solution to gain consistent visibility
    into performance, profitability, and operational efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to this initiative, insights were fragmented across different functions, making it
    difficult to assess performance holistically or identify issues early.
  </p>

  <h2>Analytical Scope &amp; Focus</h2>
  <p>The analysis was structured around key business questions across multiple functions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Revenue, costs, margins, profitability, and year-to-date performance</li>
    <li><strong>Sales:</strong> Product, customer, and channel performance, including growth trends</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Market and segment performance across regions and product categories</li>
    <li><strong>Supply Chain:</strong> Forecast accuracy, net error, and inventory risk</li>
    <li><strong>Executive Oversight:</strong> High-level KPIs supporting overall business monitoring</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each dashboard view was designed to address the needs of specific stakeholder groups while
    maintaining consistent definitions across metrics.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Modelling &amp; Metrics</h2>
  <p>
    The data model was designed using a snowflake schema, with fact tables representing transactional
    data and dimension tables providing business context such as product, customer, region, segment,
    and time.
  </p>
  <p>Key financial and operational metrics analysed include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Net Sales</li>
    <li>Gross Margin and GM%</li>
    <li>Net Profit and profitability trends</li>
    <li>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</li>
    <li>Forecast accuracy and net error</li>
    <li>Year-to-Date (YTD) and Year-to-Go (YTG) performance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This structure supports flexible analysis across business dimensions while maintaining
    performance and scalability.
  </p>

  <h2>Dashboard Design &amp; Navigation</h2>
  <p>
    The solution consists of multiple role-based dashboards accessible through a central navigation view:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Finance View:</strong> Profit &amp; Loss analysis, margin tracking, and profitability trends</li>
    <li><strong>Sales View:</strong> Product, customer, and channel performance analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing View:</strong> Market-level performance and contribution analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Supply Chain View:</strong> Forecast accuracy, net error, and inventory risk monitoring</li>
    <li><strong>Executive View:</strong> Consolidated KPIs for high-level business oversight</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Dashboards were developed based on predefined mockups to ensure usability, consistency, and
    alignment with stakeholder expectations.
  </p>

  <h2>Insight Delivery &amp; Decision Support</h2>
  <p>The dashboards support decision-making by enabling stakeholders to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare performance across time, regions, products, and segments</li>
    <li>Understand drivers behind changes in profitability and costs</li>
    <li>Identify operational risks such as forecast inaccuracies or inventory imbalance</li>
    <li>Prioritise attention across different areas of the business</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This approach supports faster insight generation and more informed decision-making across functions.
  </p>

  <h2>Tools &amp; Technologies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL for data extraction and preparation</li>
    <li>Power BI Desktop for data modelling, analysis, and dashboard development</li>
    <li>DAX for calculated measures and business metrics</li>
    <li>DAX Studio for model optimisation</li>
    <li>Power BI Service for report publishing and sharing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Takeaway</h2>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates how business data can be structured, analysed, and presented in a way
    that supports both strategic oversight and operational decision-making across multiple business functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dashboards are designed to support ongoing performance review and management discussion,
    enabling stakeholders to identify areas requiring deeper investigation or strategic action
    based on business priorities.
